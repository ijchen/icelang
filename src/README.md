# icelang

Icelang (stylized "icelang") is a simple and high-level programming language
created for the purpose of learning about programming language design and
implementation. The goal of this project is **not** to create a general-purpose
programming language for use in the real world. Although I'm not *intentionally*
making icelang a "bad" language for real-world usage, it's simply not designed
for that use case. If you're looking for a language more suitable to general
use, I'd recommend taking a look at any of the languages listed below as sources
of inspiration for the design of icelang.

icelang is dynamically typed, and intended to be an interpreted language. Some
of the design goals for icelang include:
- To be simple to understand and write an interpreter for, but still powerful
  enough to solve non-trivial problems without excessive hullabaloo
- To be expressive where doing so doesn't significantly sacrifice simplicity or
  encourage writing error-prone code
- To be provably turing-complete

The design of icelang takes inspiration from many languages, primarily
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript),
[Python](https://www.python.org), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

# TODO

icelang is still in development, and has a number of incomplete or missing features:
- [ ] Make to-do list (lol)
