# icelang

Icelang (stylized "icelang") is a simple, high-level interpreted language created for the purpose of learning about programming language design and implementation.

icelang takes inspiration from many languages, primarily [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [Python](https://www.python.org), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

# TODO
